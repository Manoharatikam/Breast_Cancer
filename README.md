##Background:
##Breast cancer is considered one of the most common cancers in women caused by various clinical, lifestyle, social, and economic factors. Machine learning has the potential to predict breast cancer based on features hidden in data.
##Objective:
##This study aimed to predict breast cancer using different machine-learning approaches applying demographic, laboratory, and mammographic data.
## Problem Statement
## Breast cancer is considered a multifactorial disease and the most common cancer in women worldwide [ 1 , 2 ] with approximately 30% of all female cancers [ 3 , 4 ] (i.e. 1.5 million women are diagnosed with breast cancer each year, and 500,000 women die from this disease in the world). Over the past 30 years, this disease has increased, while the death rate has decreased. However, the reduction in mortality due to mammography screening is estimated at 20% and improvement in cancer treatment is estimated at 60% [ 5 , 6 ].

##Diagnostic mammography can assess abnormal breast cancer tissue in patients with subtle and inconspicuous malignancy signs. Due to a large number of images, this method cannot effectively be used in assessing cancer suspected areas. According to a report, approximately 50% of breast cancers were not detected in screenings of women with very dense breast tissue [ 7 ]. However, about a quarter of women with breast cancer are diagnosed negatively within two years of screening. Therefore, the early and timely diagnosis of breast cancer is crucial [ 8 ].

##Conclusion:
##Combining multiple risk factors in modeling for breast cancer prediction could help the early diagnosis of the disease with necessary care plans. Collection, storage, and management of different data and intelligent systems based on multiple factors for predicting breast cancer are effective in disease management.
